# Python Project: Retrieving Latitude and Longitude of a Place using Google API
## Introduction:
Here I have written a code using Python Programming Language to Retrieve Latitude and Longitude of a place using Google API

## Description:

1. First we import the necessary Libraries. Like- urllib, json, ssl.
2. Then we set the Google API Key if available. But i don't have an paid API service, so I found a free API like service and set it up as an example only.
3. Then I write some code to pass ssl certificate error.
4. Now we take input of the location name from the user.
5. Encode the url.
6. Now requesting to open the url and save it to a variable. In this process we decode the data from UTF-8 to UNICODE.
7. Then load the data.
8. At last we dig into the data and print out the Latitude and Longitude of the entered place.
